# Clustering 

We have 57 full length variants. The phenotypic data for each of the partial-length variants has been mapped to one of these 57. We then can perform a hierarchical clustering with either phenotypic, structural, or genotypic data. 


## v1 assignments

saved in `assignments_v1.tsv`

These were produced without structural information; genotypic and phenotypic information were weighted equally. Seven clusters were created. 

Each row of the file provides an ORF name (same as found in out/aaseqs/K00370/long_complete_orf_ids.txt) and its cluster assignment (1 through 7).
